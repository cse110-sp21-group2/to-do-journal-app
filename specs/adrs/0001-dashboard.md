# Dashboard Implementation

## Context and Problem Statement

We are developing a digital version of a bullet journal. We want to have a feature that differentiates from the traditional analogue. We define what features the dashboard will have to not lose focus. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Whole Team

## Considered Options

* No Dashboard
* Maximal Dashboard
* Minimal Dashboard

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Minimal Dashboard", because 
* Highlights digital version, able to see relevant information at a glance
* Compared to maximal dashboard, doesn't distract from the principle of a bullet journal 
* Less complex, makes for an easier implementation.
