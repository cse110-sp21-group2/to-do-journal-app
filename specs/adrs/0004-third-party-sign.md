# Defining Sign In

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to store the journal information to the user, so we need accounts. We have a few options on how to go about this. 

## Considered Options

* Develop our own sign in system
* Implement 3rd party 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "3rd party implementation", because 
* Less time taken to develop system from scratch
    *  Existing documentation, easier implementation
* Already made accounts(i.e) gmail
