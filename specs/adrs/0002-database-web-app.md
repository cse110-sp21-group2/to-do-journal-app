# Web App Approach

## Context and Problem Statement

We are developing a digital version of a bullet journal. We want the application to be accessible from multiple devices since most students will be on the go. For this reason, we will use a web app that uses MongoDB for cross platform access.

## Considered Options

* Web App w/ local storage
* Desktop Application
* Web App using Mongo

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Web App using Mongo", because 
* Allows for cross platform access
* Some of our developers are familiar with using MongoDB
