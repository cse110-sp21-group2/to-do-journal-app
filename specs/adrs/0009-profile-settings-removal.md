# Removing Profile page

## Context and Problem Statement

We notice that most of the settings we ask for the user aren't really nessesary for what we are doing. Considering removing the page and combining both settings

## Considered Options

* Leave separate
* Combine the two
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Combine the two", because 
* Leaves one less transistion to have
* Less to update on the backend
