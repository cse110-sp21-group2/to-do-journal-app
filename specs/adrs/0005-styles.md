# Selecting Coding Styles

## Context and Problem Statement

When working in a team, it is important to understand what we are reading when picking up on work. Have to define coding styles. 

## Considered Options

* Google Coding Style
* Idiomatic
* AirBnB

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "AirBnB", because 
* Very similar to the styles many of us on the team already have
* Better formatted, allows for easier read when coding
