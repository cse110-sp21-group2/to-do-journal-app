# Defining Customizability

## Context and Problem Statement

Part of a bullet journal is the customizability. While being digital has its uses, we have to develop that customization the user can experience. How much should we implement without getting lost in a rabbit whole?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Whole Team

## Considered Options

* Range: 3 Features
* Range: 4-6 Features
* Range: 7+ Features

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Range: 4-6 Features", because 
* We want some level sort of customization for the user
* Accessibility has a good amount of checkboxes to hit, takes time to fully implement
* Features we defined are within our scope(we have ability to do
/ learn to implement)
