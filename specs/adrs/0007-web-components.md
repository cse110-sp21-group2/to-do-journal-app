# Creating Web Components

## Context and Problem Statement

Bullet journals have repeated elements across all pages. To reduce the lines we write, we are considering having web components instead. 

## Considered Options

* 4 Web components
* Type it all out for all views

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Web Components", because 
* Easier to standardize styles across multiple pages
* Easier to make a change to single element
* Less code
