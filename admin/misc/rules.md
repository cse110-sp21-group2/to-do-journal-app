    - Be accountable to the work you have to do
    - If there are any issues, be sure to communicate that with the team. We are all here to help each other out and make a great project
        - Further Emphasis: This is a class where we are all here to learn, none of us are experts. There will be confussion and thats all good.
5. **Conflict Resolution**
    - **Communication** is key, be sure to make your issues or worries known
    - If there is an issue between two or more team members, try to resolve amoung each other
    - If the issue further escalates, have one of the team leaders be as a impartial mediator
        - Note: if the issue is with team leader, go to next step
    - Upon further escalation, meet with TA and work out solutions from there
    - We have just 10 weeks in a quarter, so it can and most likely will get stressful. Be sure to be positive with each other to keep small disagreements from being conflicts.
